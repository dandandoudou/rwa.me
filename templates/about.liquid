      <h2>About me</h2>

      <p>My name is Rick Waalders and I am a designer with an engineering background. I finished a computer science degree to become a developer, but the design part of building a product has always been my biggest passion. I love finding that sweet spot of applications that aren't just looking great, but are also very easy to use.</p>

      <p>I post design work and interact with other designers on <a href="http://dribbble.com/rickwaalders">Dribbble</a>. You can also find me on <a href="http://twitter.com/rickwaalders">Twitter</a> or contact me through <a href="mailto:rwaalders@gmail.com">email</a>.</p>

      <p>As a developer, I've built applications in Objective-C, C#, PHP and of course Javascript, HTML and CSS. Every once in a while I write some Ruby too.</p>

      <p>I love to build products that help people. I've co-founded <a href="work/flitsmeister">Flitsmeister</a> with Sjoerd Perfors and started <a href="http://govisual.nl">GoVisual</a> with him and Jaco de Vries while working at <a href="http://www.omnext.net">Omnext</a>. I recently built <a href="/work/dragshare">Dragshare for Dropbox</a>. You can find more of my personal projects in the <a href="/">work</a> section of this site.</p>

      <h2>Some history</h2>

      <p>I started developing and designing websites in 1998. In 2000, I co-founded and built one of the biggest dutch music websites called 'Clubcharts'. When I finished school in 2007, I started working at <a href="http://www.omnext.net">Omnext</a>, where I've worked with bigger companies like IBM.</p>
      <p>Omnext is also the company where I met Sjoerd Perfors, with whom I started <a href="work/flitsmeister">Flitsmeister</a>, and Jaco de Vries who joined us together with Jorn de Vries to help us shape Flitsmeister into a profitable business.</p>
      <p>The last couple of years I have been focusing on designing for mobile and I've worked closely with several small startups, big companies but also individuals from all over the globe.</p>
