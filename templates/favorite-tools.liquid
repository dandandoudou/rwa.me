      <h2>Some of my favorite tools:</h2>

      <h3><a href="http://macrabbit.com/slicy/">MacRabbit Slicy</a></h3>

      <p>One of the best tools out there. Slicy cuts assets for you in retina and non-retina size by looking at your Photoshop layer names. For example: if you name a layer 'mybutton@2x.png'  and drop the PSD in Slicy, it will extract a retina PNG image and a non retina PNG image for that layer. 
      This can also speed up the way you work with other developers as a designer, as explained by Jeff Broderick in his <a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/1237570-Asset-Creation-Process">'Asset Creation Process'</a> post on Dribbble.</p>

      <h3><a href="http://csshat.com/">CSS Hat</a></h3>

      <p>CSS Hat is a Photoshop plugin that turns Photoshop layer styles into CSS3 code for any layer you have in your PSD. As of now, Photoshop CC also has this feature, but I think the code delivered by CSS Hat is way better so I prefer this one.</p>

      <h3><a href="http://bjango.com/mac/skalapreview/">Skala Preview</a></h3>

      <p>Great tool by Marc Edwards (aka <a href="http://bjango.com/">Bjango</a>) for real-time previews of app designs on your phone. Connect Photoshop through Skala Preview on your Mac with Skala View on your iPhone and every change you make in Photoshop will be mirrored in real-time on your phone. </p>

      <h3><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html">Adobe Photoshop CC</a></h3>

      <p>Still the best out there. I  love what the guys at Bohemian Coding are doing with <a href="http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a>, but at the moment I still prefer Photoshop for my daily workflow.</p>

      <h3><a href="http://guideguide.me/">GuideGuide</a></h3>

      <p>Simple, but effective. GuideGuide is a Photoshop plugin which makes it really easy to setup guides in your document. </p>

      <h3><a href="http://www.realmacsoftware.com/ember">Ember</a></h3>

      <p>Ember is software to organize your design inspiration files. It's pretty expensive but I like it over the competition because it handles having lots of files at once very well. Even on older machines it performs really fast. If you think the price is to high, have a look at cheaper alternatives like the (currently free) <a href="http://inboardapp.com/">InBoard</a> app. </p>

      <h3><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 2</a></h3>

      <p>Blazing fast text editor, available for every Desktop OS. I'm in love with the Sublime Text scrollbar :-)</p>
